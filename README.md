# lanchat-tiinaaquino

Write a Python program that:

 - discovers other computers on the same LAN
    - provides a user friendly display of information about each discovered peer

 - supports sending text messages carried in UDF packets
    - support either unicast or broadcast packet transmission
    - for either unicast or multicast chat provide a default port and allow optional 
      selection of a different port
    - allows the selection of a specific IP address for the unicast chat

 - the program should be written so that:
    - it provides useful user feed-back on errors
    - provides a '-h' or '--help' option that displays useful help for the application
